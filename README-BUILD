Welcome to HaploView!!

Introduction:

HaploView is designed to simplify and expedite the process of haplotype analysis by 
providing a common interface to several tasks relating to such analyses. HaploView currently allows users to      
examine block structures, generate haploypes in these blocks and save the data in a number of formats.
All functionalities are highly customizable.


Dependencies:

HaploView can be built using the jakarta-ant build tool. Please download this tool at:

http://jakarta.apache.org


Building:

After installing ant and putting the ant executable script in your path:

BASH export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_ant_bin_directory>

CSH setenv PATH $PATH:<path_to_ant_bin_directory>

simply type:

	ant 

The build file will then tell you can do with it.

For the lazy:

For those who hate README's simply execute the following command after installing ant and putting it
into you path environment variable:

	ant haploview
