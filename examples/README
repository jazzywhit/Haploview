The three files in this directory represent the most commonly used
file formats. They can be used to test that the program is running
correctly once it is built. They are:

----------

sample.ped -- a linkage style pedigree file which contains one
individual per line with family info plus genotypes.

sample.info -- goes with the above and provides marker name and position

These two are used together by selecting the "Linkage Format" tab
from the load dialog.

----------

sample.hmp -- a hapmap style file with all indiv and marker
information. 

This one is loaded all by itself by selecting "HapMap Format" tab
from the load dialog.
