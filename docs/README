A clean copy of this directory should contain several files used in
compiling the Haploview javahelp classes from scratch. It also
contains a precompiled version of the most recently released help
jarfile.

The ant build.xml file will almost certainly not work on your system
as it is written specifically for the machine which builds the release
versions of the code and help documentation.

It's probably best if you just leave this directory alone. :)
