Welcome to Haploview!!

Introduction:

Haploview is designed to simplify and expedite the process of
haplotype analysis by providing a common interface to several tasks
relating to such analyses.


What's here:

A clean, pruned checkout of the code should have the following:

edu/ -- the source tree
examples/ -- some sample input files 
resources/ -- some helper files
build.xml -- the ant build instruction file
README -- this file


Dependencies:

HaploView can be built using the jakarta-ant build tool. Please
download this tool at:

http://ant.apache.org


Building:

After installing ant and putting the ant executable script in your path:

BASH export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_ant_bin_directory>

CSH setenv PATH $PATH:<path_to_ant_bin_directory>

simply type:

	ant haploview
